                </div>
                <p><div>The election for the posts in the RC is called the Confined election and the election for members of SAC (President,Vice President,Council Secretaries) is called SAC election. The RC secretaries are selected through internal voting from the elected DRs & CRs.</div>
                    <div>For Confined elections, only people from one batch will vote for their batch representatives. For the SAC election, the entire student body votes for all the posts.</div>
                    </n><div> This is the general procedure that we follow for all elections: </div>
                    <div> 1.We send out the forms for nominations to the students, where you have to explain your agendas & past experience for standing for the post that you are applying for.</div>
                    <div> 2.We compile the list of candidates who apply along with their agendas to the students, so that they can get to know their prospective leaders.</div>
                    <div>3.Then there will be a campaign session, where the candidates will be given a few minutes to explain what their vision for the post is. It will be followed by a Q&A session , where the students can ask question regarding the agenda points of the candidates.</div>
                    <div> 4.It will be followed by a voting session where people cast their votes for the candidates.
